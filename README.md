Introduction
============

Sometimes you find yourself in a situation where you may want to verify
a condition before including a class, or similar. Perhaps you have custom
facts that are only set after pluginsync is enabled, but you can't enable
pluginsync until a puppet run manages `puppet.conf`. This resource type
allows you to specify an assert clause, and any dependencies of this
resource will be skipped if the assert fails.

Remember that puppet handles undefined variables as `undef` which evaluates
to `false`. This means that you can simply assert on a custom fact and it
will fail if that fact does not exist.

You can temporarily disable an assert by setting its ensure parameter to absent.

Usage
=======
```puppet
    assert { 'This should be applied':
      condition => true,
      message   => "Look at me I am in the report now",
    } -> 
    class { 'two': }
    
    assert { 'This should NOT be applied':
      condition => false,
      message   => "Look, I made your catalog run turn RED",

    } -> 
    class { 'three': }
    
    assert { 'This should be applied':
      ensure => absent,
      condition => false
    } -> 
    class { 'four': }

# other use case

assert{'linux security check':
    condition => $::linux_security_check == 'pass',  # depends on a custom fact and compares the value
    message   => 'Linux control 12345 did not pass, do what you gotta do to fix it'
}

```

Assert Type Properties
==========
* condition  (currently only accepts true or false)
* message    (overrides the title of the resource and supplies a message in the report)
* ensure     (present or absent)
